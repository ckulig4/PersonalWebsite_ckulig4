		<p><a href="index.jsp">Return to Home Page</a><br><br>
			My name is Cole Kulig and I have lived in Eau Claire on the north side which put me through all the north "named" schools.  I was never a person to play many sports, so when I was younger I played a lot of video games and watched TV. I graduated from CVTC in 2014 in the Information Technology: Network Specialist program. Now I am continuing with the IT Software Developer program. I might possibly research studying video game development as well and move onto UW Stout after graduating from CVTC.</p>
