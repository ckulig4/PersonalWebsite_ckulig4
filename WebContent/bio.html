		<h1>A short biography</h1>
		<p>My name is Cole Kulig and I have lived in Eau Claire on the north side which put me through all the north "named" schools.  I was never a person to play many sports, so when I was younger I played a lot of video games and watched TV. I graduated from CVTC in 2014 in the Information Technology: Network Specialist program. Now I am continuing with the Software/Programming programs. I might possibly research studying video game development as well.</p>
